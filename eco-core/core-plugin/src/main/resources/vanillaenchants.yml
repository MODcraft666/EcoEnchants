# Allows for modifying certain aspects of vanilla enchantments
#
enabled: false # There may be potential conflicts if modifying vanilla enchantments.

# Set custom max levels for vanilla enchantments.
# To do this, add each enchantment like this:
# - "<key>:4"
# For example, to allow efficiency 6 and protection 5, you would do this:
# max-levels:
#   - "efficiency:6"
#   - "protection:5"
#
# Currently, it is *not* possible to modify the enchantment levels from enchanting tables.
# It will work with anvils however, but since it is still possible to get enchantments at their vanilla
# max levels, then it isn't recommended to lower the max level of a vanilla enchantment, only to raise it.

# Set custom conflicts for vanilla enchantments.
# To do this, add each enchantment like this:
# - "<key>:<conflict 1 key>:<conflict 2 key>:<conflict 3 key>..... etc"
# For example, to make mending conflict with efficiency and sharpness, you would do this:
# conflicts:
#   - "mending:efficiency:sharpness"
#
# If you want to remove all conflicts, set the list to 'none':
# conflicts:
#   - "mending:none"
#
# Beware that this will *override* conflicts, not add to them.
